<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Dylan. I've been working as a Physical Therapist Assistance for nearly 10 years, and I've decided I want to
get into something different.</p>

<p>I started learning how to code online and this is a website containing some of the projects I've completed. I'm
    still learning and I'm very busy working my full time job so the process is not moving quickly.</p>

<p>I've always been interested in computers and the internet, and I have an analytical and detail oriented mind so
    I think I'll be particularly well suited to this work as well as potentially gleaning some enjoyment from the
    tasks.</p>
